==========
SUMMARY:
A File system that archives the whole system directories and files. 
Also checks for redundant files and cleans them up efficiently.

DOCUMENTATION:
There is no proper documentation for this project yet, because the project is still at 
its very infant stage. But I've taken the pain to comment out
the codes properly so it should be pretty easy to follow.
